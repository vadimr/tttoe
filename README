~ What do I need?

  You can use Vagrant to get a development
  environment (https://www.vagrantup.com/).
  Install Vagrant, run `vagrant up && vagrant ssh`.
  Now you're in a configured virtual machine (a vagrant box)
  with all requirements installed. The project directory is
  mapped to `/home/vagrant/tttoe` directory inside the box.

  Without Vagrant, you need python3, pip
  To install required packages run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
  I encourage you to use a virtualenv.

~ How can I run the web/socket server?

  run `python server.py`
  then open http://localhost:8888 in your browser.

~ How can I run the tests?

  run `make`

TODO:
* Move AI computations to workers (relax the tornado's ioloop).
* More intelligent heuristics for AI
  (to reduce the recursion depth and make the game more fun).
* Ability to control AI intelligence.
* Ability to control the speed of AI moves.
* Missing unit tests for tttoe and minimax packages.
* Missing documentation.
* Integration tests.
* Attractive UI.
